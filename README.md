## Abstract
Often in reliability studies we observe failure-time data with two dependent failure modes. In this paper, by using a bivariate Weibull model with distinct shape parameters, we present a model (MOBWDS) for reliability data with two dependent failure modes. Inferential methods for the proposed model are discussed. The efficacy of the methods of inference is assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation study, and it is observed that the model and methods perform satisfactorily. An issue of practical interest for reliability engineers is to predict field failures at a future time. Prediction methods are developed in this setting. For illustrative purposes, analysis of a real dataset on failure of a device is presented. In summary, the model and methods presented in this article provide a comprehensive treatment for analysing reliability data with two dependent failure modes.
